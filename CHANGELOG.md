# Changelog

## 2025-02-15
- Rewrote README quickstart/setup to anchor on the unified `hegemon` binary, embedded dashboard, and peer export/import bundles with runbook cross-links.
- Updated contributor and operational runbooks to deprecate the legacy Python/Vite orchestration in favor of `hegemon`-served UI flows and systemd usage on VPS seeds.
- Refreshed dashboard troubleshooting guidance to align with the embedded bundle and call out token/binding checks.
- Branding deviations: none; embedded assets remain aligned with `BRAND.md` and any future UI edits must refresh the bundled assets via `./scripts/build_dashboard.sh`.
