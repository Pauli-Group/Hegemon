# ExecPlans

When writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in .agent/PLANS.md) from design to implementation.

# Design and Methods Docs

Always consult DESIGN.md and METHODS.md before making code changes to ensure the implementation aligns with the documented plans, and update those documents whenever the architecture or methods evolve.
