# ExecPlans

When writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in .agent/PLANS.md) from design to implementation.

# Design and Methods Docs

Always consult DESIGN.md and METHODS.md before making code changes to ensure the implementation aligns with the documented plans, and update those documents whenever the architecture or methods evolve.

# README Whitepaper

Maintain the opening section of `README.md` as the canonical whitepaper for the project. The whitepaper must appear before the "Monorepo layout" and "Getting started" sections and must preserve the document title and subtitle.
